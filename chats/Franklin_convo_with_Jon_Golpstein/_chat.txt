[06/12/25, 3:03:00 p.m.] Franklin: Hi John,

I hope you’re doing very well. I just wanted to give you a quick update and a big thank you for your patience — we’re almost finished with the full list of items you mentioned. It took me a little longer to get back to you because yesterday we were fully booked at the clinic all day, and part of this morning as well.

I’d love to invite you to a Zoom meeting today between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. so you can meet Dr. Carolina personally. In that call, we’ll walk you through our main services, especially our smile-design and veneer treatments for patients traveling to Cancún. We’ll give you all the key details, treatment options, and alternatives you need so you can confidently present our proposals, answer questions, and close high-value cases.

You’re a very important part of this next chapter for us, John, and we want to equip you with everything you need to succeed. Please let me know if that time window works for you or, if not, what would be best on your side.

Is there anything we can do besides the 4 in 4     25k procedure
[11/12/25, 10:54:50 a.m.] Franklin: Hi John,

For this patient we are going to need a panoramic X-ray before we can define the final treatment plan. Once we have the pano, we’ll be able to evaluate different alternatives for her denture.

Possible options include:
	•	Making a removable prosthesis, or
	•	Converting it into a fixed prosthesis supported on tooth #14, if the conditions look favorable on the X-ray.

For now, please let her know that the panoramic X-ray is required so we can choose the best option for her case.
[11/12/25, 10:55:14 a.m.] John Golpstein: Pano or the fancy one
[11/12/25, 10:55:27 a.m.] Franklin: it’s important you mentioned panoramic x-ray
[11/12/25, 10:55:35 a.m.] Franklin: Ralph. They won’t understand exactly what we’re talking about.
[11/12/25, 10:55:41 a.m.] John Golpstein: Ok
[11/12/25, 10:59:02 a.m.] Franklin: panoramic x-ray

[11/12/25, 4:24:24 p.m.] Franklin: Hi John, I just got these feedback from specialist
-----------
Regarding the patient, I need to know Y's age. Based on the photos, I see she has an enamel defect, most likely due to medication she took as a child, specifically tetracycline-induced dental issues. I'm wondering if she's a suitable candidate for a smile makeover. She also needs to have cavities addressed, as she appears to have some in her upper front tooth. I don't think it will require a root canal, but a panoramic X-ray is important to confirm.
[11/12/25, 4:24:53 p.m.] John Golpstein: Ok
[11/12/25, 4:25:17 p.m.] Franklin: It didn’t make the translation exact
Carolina says she’s a perfect candidate for the veneers
[11/12/25, 4:34:22 p.m.] John Golpstein: She is 41
[11/12/25, 4:36:05 p.m.] Franklin: To get a proper diagnostic from the specialist. It’s always important to know their age.

Doctor Carolina, specialist in rehabilitation is requesting for clinical pictures
She says to explain to the patient that this documents are confidential between patient, doctor
They will never be disclosed
There will only be used for professional purpose
[11/12/25, 7:56:48 p.m.] John Golpstein: What do you mean
[11/12/25, 7:57:05 p.m.] John Golpstein: I will explain that nothing will be shown and is all private
[11/12/25, 7:59:36 p.m.] Franklin: Yes, it’s important. That patients understand that there is a international law of human rights that any documents or pictures that are shared between patient and doctor confidential documents.
The same as an attorney
To give him reassurance to secure that the pictures are only gonna be used for professional purpose in Dental medical services
[11/12/25, 7:59:56 p.m.] John Golpstein: Understand
[11/12/25, 8:00:14 p.m.] Franklin: We just created a group, so you could talk directly with Dr. Carolina
[11/12/25, 8:00:28 p.m.] John Golpstein: Great   I’ll start sending photos there
[11/12/25, 8:00:33 p.m.] John Golpstein: And questions
[12/12/25, 11:32:08 a.m.] John Golpstein: Hey can you answer on the group one about the lady with x rays

[13/12/25, 11:53:58 a.m.] Franklin: John, since Christmas is around the corner, we want to launch a limited holiday promotion to create urgency and drive volume:

“Buy 1 Smile Design, Get 2 Smile Designs for the Price of 1.”
In other words: 2 Smile Designs for the price of 1 (Holiday Special).

This will be used across ads, the landing page, and WhatsApp. Please confirm the cleanest way to position it on calls (who qualifies, how you’ll present it, and how you’ll handle timing/availability) so we can deploy it immediately.
