the first screen concise.
• Clarify trust signals: sterilization protocols, technology, licensed specialists, and written
plan/warranty terms for qualifying procedures.
• Make the package inclusions scannable (flights, resort, private transfers, concierge, Smile Design
appointment, premium materials).
• Add a short, explicit "What happens after you reserve" section with the 3-step flow (priority
scheduling, concierge coordination, candidacy review).
• Add a clear "How payment works" section (30% treatment deposit; $397 reservation is credited
toward that deposit; balance options).
• Add compliant savings language (avoid absolutes; state that savings vary vs. U.S. pricing and
depend on treatment/resort/season).
• CTA: WhatsApp booking +52 984 114 5997 and a QR block placeholder.
