Okay. So now that I have this audience…

Okay, I have just selected “destination,” which means I need to log into Meta.
Which means you guys need to actually give me access to this account.

But this is the one that you’re currently doing that’s in their accounting.
So there’s their account and your account.

Both of them are our account. Everything is in our account.
But there’s two separate accounts.

Got it. We have two separate accounts.
But they can see the other accounts—everything.
They can see everything, but they can’t change the other thing.

Here, look:
This account that’s currently running ads is different than this account that’s…

No, no, no, no. That’s separate.
Here, hold on. I have it right here. It’s somewhere here. Hold on.

That was the one I had…
No, that was it, bro.

What was that? Hold on. Whoa, whoa—
We need to fix that.

No, no, no. How do I fix that?
But you’re still doing ads, so at least it’s that.

Okay, that being said: I need you to invite me.
Please, no promo.

Go for it. You’re invited.

(Mamita / mom phone call)

How did you do that?
No, no, but this fucking keyboard—they fucked it out here.

Trust me here, okay? If I [do this], I’ll never be here.
I know. That’s how he has full control.

That’s bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
I’m gonna take him off full control now.

I don’t want him to have full control like that.
He could fuck us up anytime he fucking wants.

(Spanish / mom convo)

Okay, beautiful. So that—I went through.

Okay, so now you have full access, and he does as well.
Well, we don’t want to change that just yet.

Right. You got a code, I got a code, you got a code.

But he’s gonna know—he’s gonna get an email or something that you were in.
He’s gonna know.

Fuck. So we gotta go quick, is that what you’re saying?
Yep. He’s gonna know for sure that you’re there. Sean.

But he’s always, always known that I work with you—
Even the day you called me from the U.S. for Thanksgiving, he was in the car.

Yeah, I saw that. So he knows you and I are friends.

I know. I watched this man wrap his tentacles around you and didn’t stop him.
I’m not laughing. That’s what this is for.

And guess what? I’m happy because we’re making a difference.
We’re taking action, and that’s everything.

That is everything when you take action.

Gotcha. Thank you, brother.

⸻

So, I just need to get into Gmail. Stay here.

Where is he? Is he just in the partner section?
There he is. There he is. Okay, thank you.

Now you’re looking—hold on, what’s going on?
Missing permission?

Because this is just assigning them.
It’s not going to allow an assigned by you.

Full control, full control, full control… right?

Yeah, but not right now.

Create, manage, delete posts.
Review and respond to comments.
Remove unwanted content and report activity.
Send and respond to messages.

Is he…?
This is a page. This is not the ad account.

Okay, hold on—
We just need to look at the fucking ad account.

So real quick:
These will [apply] to everything, right?

If you give him partial control, this is things in the business page / business tools (Meta Suite).
It means you can’t switch into page or do sensitive tasks.

Partial control?

Before we press “assign assets,” because he’s gonna get a notification.
Of course he’s…

These are all the ad accounts. Do we know which one it is?
We don’t.

But just fucking take a—
Wait, wait, wait. No, I wouldn’t want to do that.

Oh, okay. Wouldn’t want to do that.
Why? Because he’s gonna be freaking out. He’s gonna freak the fuck out.

There you go.

Okay, so we’re gonna grab this one… the 16—this one. This is the account.
I know, I know.

This is the account:
22, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 6, 8, 6, 1, 2, 0, 87.  (as spoken)

Okay, let’s take a look at the other ones.

So he’s running these.
Yeah. He’s running those three ads.

You built this ad campaign all by yourself.
Yeah, Mexican. And the picture too.

No, the pictures were done with all campaigns.
So we just got those old pictures and used them in a new campaign.

Okay. But it’s not working properly.

[00:02.000] Hmm.
[00:04.000] Antonio.
[00:06.000] Buenas tardes. Hola.
[00:07.000] Sí, buenas tardes. Eh, ¿qué le puedo servir? ¿Está interesado en el diseño de sonrisa?
[00:13.000] No, no, no, nada, es que se aplazó solo.
[00:16.000] ¿Cómo? Disculpe.
[00:20.000] Aló.
[00:20.000] He said wrong number.
[00:22.000] He he said wrong number. He dialed wrong.
[00:28.000] Interesante.
[00:31.000] P. P. P. P. P.
[00:33.000] Those are the kind of leads that we're getting that are no good.
[00:37.000] Es solo P. P. P. P.
[00:39.000] This is just getting like fake leads. No.
[00:41.000] Well, this is the Mexican one.
[00:43.000] Yeah. All right.
[00:44.000] Now here's the thing. If you're going to get in Mexico, of course, I'm not saying that that's going to be all of them. That's going to be the majority of them because you don't have any sort of filters. So look,
[00:52.000] They did. Well, so you might have filters but there are certain filters that Facebook can't put on there such as income.
[00:58.000] Mmm.
[01:02.000] Right? Because that's discriminatory. So they say, they don't want to get into any trouble. That being said, if we start with a list and give it to Facebook,
[01:06.000] Okay.
[01:09.000] and say, look, this is. You have that list now? Dude. Yeah. Look, what's up? All right, so look.
[01:10.000] Baby, what's up?
[01:14.000] This is what I just want to walk you through how it works first because we got interrupted. Okay.
[01:19.000] This right here is 115,000 moms with kids.
[01:24.000] Is she's got to translate?
[01:25.000] She's got to translate.
[01:27.000] Okay.
[01:30.000] So this is 115,000 moms with kids who make above $79,000 but less than $200,000 a year. Here's where all of them live. All of them live. Here's their credit ratings. Mostly mostly they go towards the 750s to 790s.
[01:35.000] Mm.
[01:44.000] Mm.
[01:45.000] or 700 to 799. Net worth doesn't matter as much, but here's the thing. Look, see all these?
[01:48.000] We went ahead and of the 115,000, we matched to uh, 80,000 to 100,000. That's a really good match rate. Normally it's 12 to 15%. You'd be lucky.
[01:53.000] How much percentage did you get now?
[02:08.000] Uh, well, if it says it says because that's the thing. Facebook doesn't give us the exact amount. It says 85,000 to 100,000. So out of 115,000, we got 73% to about an 86%.
[02:10.000] What?
[02:24.000] Great match rate. Absolutely phenomenal. So here's what's going to happen. Every single week this gets refreshed with all the new moms who are looking for side hustle.
[02:31.000] And gets updated. Holy fuck, you're going to rock shit. Congratulations.
[02:32.000] Here you go. It's going to get.
[02:38.000] Okay, how can we apply this dentist solutions?
[02:41.000] Well, here you go. I've already got a freaking like audience built for you.
[02:45.000] Dun dun dun dun dun. Dun dun dun dun dun.
[02:49.000] Dun dun dun dun. Well, cuz there's more there's more that we have to do. So hold on. Let me go ahead. Let me get my charger.
[02:54.000] Okay. It's muy importante.
[02:58.000] Ow.
[03:00.000] I'm going to put some tunes here. Like some mellow mellow mellow.
[03:03.000] Here's the thing. Here's the thing.
[03:04.000] Wait, something's really really important here. If you're talking about applying this to your campaign, we can't swap out the campaign while it's running.
[03:09.000] Right.
[03:17.000] You got to get this now. You have to swap it out or duplicate or duplicate and set the same.
[03:18.000] No, we don't have it now.
[03:25.000] Okay, we could duplicate it. We could duplicate it once we have a little money because duplicating means money.
[03:32.000] You got to spend money, my boy.
[03:34.000] I know, but we're almost there. We're almost going to close this out. Let me let me know. Cierra la paciente está con John. La lipo. Consígale la lipo.
[03:39.000] Oye, amor, un momento.
[03:45.000] Pero es que
[03:49.000] Es que necesito cómo decirle a John porque va así yo no.
[03:51.000] Y por qué no le hablas al chat GPT y le dices, oiga, yo necesito decirle a John lo mismo.
[03:54.000] Okay.
[03:59.000] No.
[04:02.000] Es que tengo aquí donde Cell inicial de
[04:05.000] Ah, okay, listo. Entonces le dices ahí como tú quieras, menos. más cómodo.
[04:07.000] Solo qué qué es lo que quieres decirle a yo y te va a guiar paso a paso cómo decirle a yo. Sí.
[04:10.000] Okay.
[04:18.000] You know what they say?
[04:20.000] Slow is smooth and smooth is fast. You know who says that? US Navy.
[04:22.000] Who?
[04:27.000] US Marines actually.
[04:29.000] Wow. Marines.
[04:31.000] Well, they're the same, right? No. The Navy or not the Marines?
[04:33.000] The Marines, not all Marines are Navy, or not all Navy are Marines but all Marines are Navy.
[04:36.000] Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm.
[04:41.000] Okay, so I know I had already created an audience for you. So let me just go ahead and find that real quick. And then I'm going to go ahead and actually account attach my Facebook. And I'll show you how this is going to work.
[04:45.000] It's the wrong one. Here we go.
[05:03.000] Thank God you have like a freaking monster computer.
[05:12.000] My computer is like, oh, joy, another tab.
[05:22.000] Yeah, but it's not that fast, honestly. It's four years old and also, um, it's an M1 chip. We're on the M4 now.
[05:24.000] Uh-huh.
[05:31.000] Holy shit.
[05:32.000] So, and I got it like right before the M2 came out. So it was like almost updated by the time I got it.
[05:37.000] But that's what's going to happen.
[05:38.000] It's always going to happen. It's always going to happen.
[05:42.000] It's ridiculous. It's always going to happen.
[05:45.000] All right, so we're in audience lists. Come on. There we go. Dental. See if I have it in here. So I've got Dental Solution problem aware, Dental Solutions solution aware and Dental Solution product aware. Those are definitely not correct. So let's go ahead, there's definitely not 400,000 people that are looking for Like maybe we just have it way too the the keywords are way too broad, right? Missing teeth solutions. Affordable dental solutions abroad. We want specifically veneers. Yeah.
[05:50.000] No, no.
[05:54.000] But non-invasive. People that want to preserve their natural teeth teeth. People that are looking for beautiful smile, aligned, white teeth without having a.
[06:08.000] Dental solution we've got this one right here, which is Dental Tourism Mexico.
[06:17.000] What about them?
[06:34.000] 43,000 people.
[06:43.000] Mm.
[06:47.000] That's a lot of people.
[06:49.000] Just about enough to run a a good audience too. A good a good campaign too.
[06:56.000] I see. There's also affordable dental implants abroad, full dental reconstruction, smile design, veneers, and dental implants.
[07:03.000] To be amazing.
[07:04.000] 73,000 people searching for veneers in the past.
[07:07.000] Wow. When we looked it up, right? And this was again, uh, just veneers, any veneers, right?
[07:11.000] You don't want coffee?
[07:16.000] I'm good.
[07:21.000] And this was specifically with those with a net worth of $150,000 or more. That's positive, meaning if they own a home, their house is paid off or their assets outweigh their house by $150,000.
[07:35.000] Okay. Positive in the positive direction, right? So they're not in debt. That means they probably got a pretty good credit score, but if we filter by credit score plus net worth, then we're going to get a much smaller list. We don't want that. This is specifically with those with verified personal emails. Now, this was over a month ago. So I'm going to press preview and see what we got now.
[07:55.000] 60,700 or $60,554 that have searched for this. Just veneers, no age, no gender, just net worth. Okay?
[08:02.000] Fuck yeah, dude, I wanted that list. I was dying for this, bro.
[08:14.000] There you go.
[08:19.000] So, here's the thing, man.
[08:20.000] I really wanted this.
[08:22.000] We can go ahead and replace what's in there right now.
[08:26.000] We can't. I don't have the budget and.
[08:28.000] But it'll stop.
[08:29.000] That's the problem. I can't. It's not the time. I'll fuck up. I'll fuck everything up if I even dare.
[08:31.000] So we've got to duplicate it.
[08:36.000] I don't have the money yet.
[08:37.000] Exactly.
[08:38.000] Let me let me Okay, let's have everything. Let's move on with getting the landing page. Let's move on with getting Abe a little bit, you know, not to have me by the balls as he asked me right now.
[08:43.000] Cuz right? I mean, fuck, if we did dental solutions and somebody paid it off, that all those payments would be going directly to Abe unless we shut off the account and switched it over to this one right here. But here's the thing, man, the second that you get paid from this, that $3,000, I'm going to tell you exactly what it's going to go towards. Cuz you're you're it's inevitable. You will get at least a sale.
[08:50.000] Of course.
[09:11.000] At least a sale. Of course it's inevitable. You got it. It's inevitable. So the moment that that happens, right? Yes. We're going to spend anywhere from $100 to $300 on an LLC, whether you want an instant bank account or not, right? And all of the different forms that you need to complete completed for you and mail forwarding probably.
[09:12.000] We're going to get a bank account. We're going to start with dental solutions. Until we have the money.
[09:56.000] And then we're also going to spin up a new campaign. Okay? All I need all that we need is all we need is a couple of thousand bucks. We actually don't even need that much just to start out.
[09:57.000] Mm.
[10:03.000] M.
[10:09.000] Mm.
[00:00.000] Does Abe expect you to go through uh payment preferred? He said, of course he's expecting that. Of course he's expecting that. So, you're going to Do you have a 100 bucks, or 300 bucks to put down? Not right now. Not today. Unfortunately. My my Mexican campaign. If I could get a graphic designer for my Mexican campaign. Wait, come back over here.
