Okay. So now that I have this audience…

Okay, I have just selected “destination,” which means I need to log into Meta.
Which means you guys need to actually give me access to this account.

But this is the one that you’re currently doing that’s in their accounting.
So there’s their account and your account.

Both of them are our account. Everything is in our account.
But there’s two separate accounts.

Got it. We have two separate accounts.
But they can see the other accounts—everything.
They can see everything, but they can’t change the other thing.

Here, look:
This account that’s currently running ads is different than this account that’s…

No, no, no, no. That’s separate.
Here, hold on. I have it right here. It’s somewhere here. Hold on.

That was the one I had…
No, that was it, bro.

What was that? Hold on. Whoa, whoa—
We need to fix that.

No, no, no. How do I fix that?
But you’re still doing ads, so at least it’s that.

Okay, that being said: I need you to invite me.
Please, no promo.

Go for it. You’re invited.

(Mamita / mom phone call)

How did you do that?
No, no, but this fucking keyboard—they fucked it out here.

Trust me here, okay? If I [do this], I’ll never be here.
I know. That’s how he has full control.

That’s bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
I’m gonna take him off full control now.

I don’t want him to have full control like that.
He could fuck us up anytime he fucking wants.

(Spanish / mom convo)

Okay, beautiful. So that—I went through.

Okay, so now you have full access, and he does as well.
Well, we don’t want to change that just yet.

Right. You got a code, I got a code, you got a code.

But he’s gonna know—he’s gonna get an email or something that you were in.
He’s gonna know.

Fuck. So we gotta go quick, is that what you’re saying?
Yep. He’s gonna know for sure that you’re there. Sean.

But he’s always, always known that I work with you—
Even the day you called me from the U.S. for Thanksgiving, he was in the car.

Yeah, I saw that. So he knows you and I are friends.

I know. I watched this man wrap his tentacles around you and didn’t stop him.
I’m not laughing. That’s what this is for.

And guess what? I’m happy because we’re making a difference.
We’re taking action, and that’s everything.

That is everything when you take action.

Gotcha. Thank you, brother.

⸻

So, I just need to get into Gmail. Stay here.

Where is he? Is he just in the partner section?
There he is. There he is. Okay, thank you.

Now you’re looking—hold on, what’s going on?
Missing permission?

Because this is just assigning them.
It’s not going to allow an assigned by you.

Full control, full control, full control… right?

Yeah, but not right now.

Create, manage, delete posts.
Review and respond to comments.
Remove unwanted content and report activity.
Send and respond to messages.

Is he…?
This is a page. This is not the ad account.

Okay, hold on—
We just need to look at the fucking ad account.

So real quick:
These will [apply] to everything, right?

If you give him partial control, this is things in the business page / business tools (Meta Suite).
It means you can’t switch into page or do sensitive tasks.

Partial control?

Before we press “assign assets,” because he’s gonna get a notification.
Of course he’s…

These are all the ad accounts. Do we know which one it is?
We don’t.

But just fucking take a—
Wait, wait, wait. No, I wouldn’t want to do that.

Oh, okay. Wouldn’t want to do that.
Why? Because he’s gonna be freaking out. He’s gonna freak the fuck out.

There you go.

Okay, so we’re gonna grab this one… the 16—this one. This is the account.
I know, I know.

This is the account:
22, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 6, 8, 6, 1, 2, 0, 87.  (as spoken)

Okay, let’s take a look at the other ones.

So he’s running these.
Yeah. He’s running those three ads.

You built this ad campaign all by yourself.
Yeah, Mexican. And the picture too.

No, the pictures were done with all campaigns.
So we just got those old pictures and used them in a new campaign.

Okay. But it’s not working properly.
