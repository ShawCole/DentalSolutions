So A pressured you to start the campaigns before you were ready.

And he’s been doing all this free work for you, and he’s now saying, “don’t fuck me,”
but he’s kind of fucked you—because you asked.

But he’s saying all the time:
“Maybe some time to get the landing pages up and running,”
and he said, “No—get the campaign up and up now.”

So he built the landing pages.
You said, “Wait, we can’t start until you have a closer.”

He said, “Go, go, go—we have to start now.”

Now you’ve uploaded all of this ad spend,
and now you’re in the hole $3,000.

Not yet anymore. Almost. We’re hungry. Right?
