In one week, we got like 90 leads. Okay.
One of those leads, good leads were like 56. Okay.

And I’m driving back and forth, I’m tired, we’re BC. I need to close.
I need a closer.

So we took like almost two weeks to find the closer, make the campaign, finally got the closer.
Now we got the closer. It’s a good closer. We should meet him. Good guy.

So, he’s already got, like, a few people almost lined up, right?
But I think we’re doing really well.

Yeah. The AI, Nicole thinks it needs a little bit more work. Okay.
But it is working, right?

And we invested $100 a day. So $3,000 in a month. Nice. That’s what we’re doing.
And we’re hitting all U.S. Yes.

And he’s not, I don’t think he’s profiling. He’s just doing it to the masses. Beautiful.
So he says it doesn’t matter what leads we get—the AI will kind of filter them out (the no good vs the good), and then the closer will get them here.

⸻

Might if I take a look? Please.

Okay, so you’ve got two campaigns going on right now.
	•	The American (forget about that in draft).
	•	This one right here.

Great, so we’ve got four ad sets.
It says delivery and draft, which means that there’s a couple that haven’t been published.

Go ahead and scroll down… there we go:
Ad sets for campaign: “Broad 25+ audiences.”

I wonder if that means 25+ age-wise, or 25 different audiences.
Let’s click on that.

You’ve got two… well, three.
This one has unpublished edits, but it is active.
Let’s publish edits.

So there were changes made that haven’t been finalized.
But looking through this, that is what we have 140 leads from.

How long has this been running for?
A week. Well, like I said, we started it one week and then we stopped it for like two weeks, and we started it again.

Already paid. Amount spent says $15,000 already.
$1,000 last time, I don’t know why it says 15. Wow. It was $1,000… I don’t know.

Okay—let’s break down these numbers real quick.
That’s why I needed to talk to you, really. Jeez, emergency.

Reach: 30,246
Impressions: 41,754

Impressions vs reach means people saw it more than once.
Some saw it 3, 4, or 5 times.

Seven-day click… it’s really easy to spend a shitload of money on ads very quickly.
Facebook wants your money.

It says $15,425.52 spent in the last seven days?
We paid $12, something already. Got it.

The next bill is gonna come due soon (end of the year).

Now, the worst thing somebody can do with their agency when they first get into something like this is panic and peace out.
Because the sales cycle just hasn’t caught up yet.

If we get at least one person down here, it’ll cover.
Two, you’ll be in the green.
Three will be like, yeah, yeah.

So don’t freak out.
But I am freaking out.

It might just be the cost of doing business—to get the flow you need.
If you can break even, keep going.
But don’t freak out after a week because you haven’t made a sale yet.

That being said: we gotta analyze the fuck out of it.

(Coffee / watermelon / knife / carajillo conversation)

⸻

Back to the math.

That means the average person saw that video 1.38 times.

Cost per result / lead forms:
You got 140 lead forms filled out.

So: 140 / 30,246 = 0.46% conversion rate.

At $100 a day, you don’t want to change that when you’re locked in.
Worst thing you can do is change it.

You paid $110 a lead form…
But: “Pesos. Pesos.” (clarification)

So it’s not $15,000 USD—it’s pesos.

Roughly: 18.2 pesos per dollar (around $5–$6 per lead).
US dollar is dropping (18 on the dot, but exchanges won’t give you 18; Wise gives floating rate).

Creative review notes:
	•	“Very clean… professional.”
	•	“Everything looks great, but I would change that logo at the end. It’s hard to read.”
	•	“Need a thicker border / white bubble.”
	•	“Easy fix: cut off end of video, keep audio, replace with better logo.”
	•	“This is called ad optimization.”

⸻

Landing page issues:

Website sucks (as stated).
Domain situation: dental solutionscare.com (built), dental solutions.mx (owned, not built).

Need to “see it through” until end of January.
“You built a paper airplane and let it go.”

Landing page: dentalsolutionscare.com/VIP program (go.dentalsolutionscare.com).

Mobile view problem:
What everyone on mobile sees right now is giving protagonism to the resort, not the clinic.

Needs:
	1.	Clinic-focused story (not resort).
	2.	Better clinic video.
	3.	Page should be an organized journey (not mixed/disorganized).
	4.	Must position as luxury VIP (not “Tijuana cheap”).

Assets / ownership concern:
He owns the GoHighLevel assets / pages.
Pages are loading slow because assets are loaded directly onto the site.
Some pages show blank previews; not loading due to heavy assets.

He didn’t customize branding/logo much. Disappointing.
He wants 15% partnership—“This is not how you do business.”

CRM / pipeline snapshot:
	•	67 new opportunities not contacted yet
	•	1 inbound phone call opportunity
	•	9 opportunities responded to
	•	7 opportunities requested to start moving
	•	13 booked consultations
	•	0 confirmed consultation
	•	0 shown consultation
	•	0 ignored / no-show
	•	0 negotiation
	•	0 treatment confirmed
	•	0 procedure done
	•	25 re-engagement
	•	27 lost
	•	0 ghosted / DNC / DNQ

Problem callout:
Opportunities say “tomorrow” instead of a specific date.
Example: created Dec 15 at 6pm; note says “tomorrow 10am” but today is Dec 17—so the consult likely already happened.
Why is it still in “booked consultations”? Was it a no-show? Did anyone follow up?

Need to dig into data to see what John is doing.
Need weekly check-ins / communication and SOPs.

⸻

Sales process advice:

To stand up closers, you need to have done the sale yourself first.
Then build SOPs: script, cadence, questions, follow-up process, recording everything.
If closers don’t have SOPs, they invent their own process (often misaligned).

Recommendation: hire two closers at the same time and have them compete for one role.

Meta Mexico campaign snapshot:

Since Dec 4 (15 days):
	•	Reach: ~28,000
	•	Avg frequency: ~3
	•	Spend: 4,500 pesos (~$800-ish mentioned)
	•	121 messaging conversations started
	•	Messenger: 112
	•	Instagram: 2
	•	WhatsApp Business: 7
	•	6 blocked
	•	42 replied

Ad issues: “The ad sucks… not enough assets.”
Before/after not allowed on Facebook; Instagram more lenient.

Optimization phase:
You’re online, started, have AI, closer, pipeline.
Not perfect, now optimize.

⸻

Partnership / payment processing concern:

He has you “by the balls” because he owns assets + bank account.
Strategy: replace assets one at a time so you can remove dependency.

Payment: Patient Preferred / payout routing needs to be controlled by your entity.
Solution discussed: set up a Wyoming LLC for payment processing, then switch payout account.

Timing:
	•	LLC + bank account takes a couple weeks for full setup (cost: couple hundred bucks).
	•	If non-American, EIN approval may take 2–4 months depending on scenario (as discussed).

⸻

Pricing + offer details:

Average case: $9,000
Will drop to: $6,000
Absolute lowest: $5,000

Treatment logistics:
Non-invasive veneers can be a 1–3 day trip.
Often: come in, procedure, stay night, check next day, then fly back.

Deposit policy:
Originally 30% (sometimes 39% mentioned), but many refuse to pay upfront.
Alternative: “No problem—buy ticket, come down, send flight info, we’ll pick you up; pay when here.”

Current stance: no Patient Preferred until payout account is under your control.

Break-even math (minimum $5,000 case):
	•	Closer commission (10%): $500
	•	Doctor (20%): $1,000
	•	Clinic/licensing/insurance est: $500
Leaves: $3,000 (target take-home / break-even benchmark)

⸻

Closer commission structure (needs clarification in writing):
	•	0–5 sales: 10% per sale
	•	6–7 sales: 15% per sale
	•	8–10 sales: 20% per sale

Critical: clarify whether tier applies per-sale at that point (not retroactive aggregate), and document it.
Otherwise it’s the difference between ~$7k vs $10k commission on 10 sales at $5k each.

⸻

Positioning strategy:

You’re not selling “veneers.”
You’re selling a “dental transformation.”

Three paths to success:
	•	Do it first
	•	Do it better
	•	Do it cheaper

Cheaper attracts the clientele you don’t want.
Better only works if people understand you exist and why you’re better.

Action: kick-ass ads + kick-ass landing page + kick-ass website.
